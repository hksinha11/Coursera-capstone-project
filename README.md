## Introduction/Business Problem

Every city is built on different circumstances, environment and different constraints. I am going to compare the neighborhoods of of 2 major columns and how can they be compared with respect to places to eat, better connectivity to several useful regions and how are they distributed around both cities. The places I will be considering are airports, metro, coffee shop, restaurants, schools, college, general stores, hospitals etc. The audience will be tourists who consider travelling through national capital of the 2 cities analyzed and search for better neighborhoods suited for their needs.

## Data Section

The data used to calculate is available for New york and the other half i.e. for toronto has been been scraped for wikipedia. Both of the dataset consist of the boroughs, neighborhoods and the locations of them. The foursqaure api will be used to analyze the places nearby these neighborhoods and see the proximity of important places from the corresponding neighborhoods.
